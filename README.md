# mosu - my osu or how to set up [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh) for best the experience on Mac

## My setup
- MacBook Pro 13" from 2018 in the basic configuration
    - macOS Mojave
- Apple Magic Keyboard
- One by Wacom (CTL-472)

### Why not upgrade to the lates OS?
- macOS Catalina (10.15) has dropped the support for 32-bit applications meaning the osu! stable that is running on Wine is not working (at least there were no ports for Wine to 64-bit when I was trying it out)

## Running the game
- There are two official versions of the osu! game

### osu! stable
- This is the old osu! client that is still the main one (at the time of writing this)
### osu! lazer
